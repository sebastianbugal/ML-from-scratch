# Machine Learning From Scratch!
This repository is just a little playground for me to try and write a variety of machine learning algorithms from scratch. The goal of this repo is for me to better understand the inner workings of some machine learning algorithms to be able to better apply them in practice.
To test run '''python test.py''' in any of the directories
